        <font size="6"><strong>Introduction</strong></font>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <font size="4">The two most important factors military or civilian advisors should
            consider when engaging with host nation counterparts are knowledge transfer
            and reform mitigation because the two work in concert together to guarantee
            mission success. One without the other generally leads to failure or lacks
            in progress. From a business perspective, advising is another form of consulting.
            In consulting, knowledge transfer develops best practices, and streamlines workflow
            processes to strengthen capacity. Increases to capacity, in turn, raises abilities
            to carry out successful reform. Reform mitigation in this sense refers to host nations
            navigating conflicts that for example may include bureaucratic constraints,
            corruption, etc. During this week in Campaigns, Operational Advising, and
            Strategic Threats, (COAST), we were introduced to an array of topics.
            Under knowledge transfer, we first learned how the New York Police Department
            (NYPD) diversified domestic, and international criminal justice practices.
            Later, we discovered the growing role of inclusivity, by both women and other
            cultures, such as Asian Americans. This paper will delve deeper into these areas,
            and later explain host nation benefits and reforms for each.</font>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <font size="6"><strong>Knowledge Transfer</strong></font>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <font size="4">Knowledge transfer serves as a key factor between advisors and
            host nation counterparts. There, advisor expertise is shared to develop ways to
            improve and streamline status quo procedures and techniques. Take for instance, in
            Afghanistan, and the use of Embedded Police Mentors (EPM) in ANDSF development.
            In the past, companies such as DynCorp and Raytheon sought experienced former police
            contractors as trainers and advisors on small unit advisor groups, such
            as Security Force Advisory Teams (SFAT). The thought process went that
            contractors would serve as law enforcement subject matter experts (SME)
            to incorporate best practices to improve productivity in areas as recruiting
            and police training.</font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font size="4">Monitoring trends is another task advisors should consider
            under knowledge transfer. By doing so, advisors keep host nation counterparts
            abreast of the latest best practices. As I mentioned earlier, and because
            stability plays such an important role in security force assistance, the NYPD
            has incorporated five key initiatives to increase their law enforcement capacity.
            By implementing new measures, the NYPD significantly decreased regional crime,
            considered by many to be one of the most diverse worldwide hubs. Although many
            of the practices may be beyond most host nations' reach, such as technology,
            openness to demonstrate parallel initiatives could be revolutionary.</font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font size="4">Inclusivity is another area of interest. Two specific
            topics here include the role of women and other cultures. Recently,
            I read GEN (R) Stanley McChrystal's 2016 Senate Armed Forces testimony
            regarding the use of cross-functional teams to streamline DoD
            procedures at the Pentagon. In sum, McChrystal advocated their
            importance in building trust, a key host nation advisory pillar.
            By building trust, he stated that organizations under his command
            broke hierarchal barriers. Cross functional teams, composed of
            personnel from different backgrounds, enable organizations to tackle
            broad problem ranges through creative innovation.</font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font size="4">The cross functional team concept is a Special
            Operations Forces (SOF) staple. In that area, for years SOF used
            broad ranges of military occupational specialties (MOS) on small
            unit teams. However, while they were initially exclusive to men,
            SOF followed Marine Corps lessoned learned in the development of
            Cultural Support Teams (CST) in the Global War on Terror (GWOT).
            By expanding women's roles, SOF increased counter-insurgency objective
            success. On a larger scale, nations can demonstrate inclusivity as well.
            Take for instance, the quadrilateral mechanism, a 2016 initiative pairing China,
            Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan in a military collaboration against
            terrorist and extremist forces. The mechanism enables the four countries
            to coordinate and support each other in the study of counter terrorism,
            intelligence sharing, antiterrorist capability building, and joint anti-
            terrorist and personnel training. Here, concerted efforts display openness
            to meld together in the fight to maintain stable nations from terrorism.</font>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <font size="6"><strong>Reform Mitigation</strong></font>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <font size="4">Following the conversation of knowledge transfer, and considering
            the benefits of best practices trends and inclusivity, how can nations best ensure
            reform survival? The answer lies in an increased capacity. Capacity building is
            the output of key advisor efforts. It goes without saying that protracted
            partnered operations are not ideal. Take for example the U.S. role in
            Afghanistan. There, the end state has been for years become taglines
            and mission statements for handing the Afghans best practices to maintain
            a stable state autonomously. For one, increased capacity allows partnered
            nations to withdraw preconceived solutions and allow host nations to refine
            holistic, sustainable processes. Another perspective is that capable partners
            increase their abilities to manage and prevent conflicts affecting reform. A
            final increased capacity benefit is that nations can develop and strengthen inter-
            and intra-governmental partnerships.</font>
    </p>

    <h2>
        <font size="6"><strong>The Pay Off</strong></font>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <font size="4">What do nations really have to gain from remaining stagnant
            and not evolving? For one, they may be viewed negatively by partnered
            nations and future alliances. With the rise of globalization and media
            exposure, how nations exploit opportunities to establish stability resonates
            on the world stage. For one, it could affect economic partnerships that could
            increase its population's quality of life. From another budgetary point of view,
            rarely will all partnered costs be just that. Nations will also absorb security
            force assistance costs in some form or another, whether monetary or in lives.
            A final point is that damages nation credibility and legitimacy. This paints
            host nations in a negative light that corruption or ineptness trumps the
            responsibility to protect citizens. </font>

    <h2>
        <font size="6"><strong>Summary</strong></font>
    </h2>

    <p>
        <font size="4">Knowledge transfer and reform mitigation are the two most
            important factors military or civilian advisors should consider when engaging
            with host nation counterparts because they work in concert together to guarantee
            mission success. Experts leverage experience and other skills to strengthen
            partner viewpoints. However, advisor efforts are ineffective if partnered
            nations capacity fails to grow significantly. While many other factors
            could certainly be considered, in the end advising's goals are to increase
            capacity to allow autonomous governance to thrive.</font>
